## [Motivations](#Motivations) ##

I was curious to see how certain neighbourhoods are reflected based on their reviews, price of rental and criminal incidents in Boston.

I wanted to break this down by looking at how:
1. Which are the most popular areas among the customers?
2. How prices are fluctuated between seasonal periods?
3. Do crime have an impact on pricing and rental ability?
